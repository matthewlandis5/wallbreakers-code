Wallbreakers Week #5
  Goals For This Week
    Whether it's the graph of all websites and hyperlinks as used by Google to rank search results, 
    or it's Facebook's massive graph of social connections, or the tree structure that is used to 
    organize your files on your computer, graphs and trees are ubiquitous in computer science and its applications. 
    This week we want you to practice solving graph and tree problems and become familiar with tree and graph traversals, 
    shortest path algorithms, minimum span trees, and topological sort, among other algorithms.
